# Seven Laws of Identity - HeroSSID Implementation

## Overview

This document maps Kim Cameron's [Seven Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf) to the HeroSSID self-sovereign identity platform implementation. These laws form the foundational principles for federated identity systems and guide our architectural decisions.

## The Seven Laws

### 1. User Control and Consent

**Principle**: Users give permission to share data, and they have at least some say in how shares happen.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: âœ… **Implemented (Phase 2)**

- **DID Creation**: Users have full control over DID creation through CLI commands
  - Location: [DidCommands.cs:31-55](../../src/Cli/HeroSSID.Cli/Commands/DidCommands.cs#L31)
  - User initiates: `herossid did create`

- **Private Key Ownership**: Users own their private keys, encrypted and stored locally
  - Location: [DidCreationService.cs:89-94](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.DidOperations/Services/DidCreationService.cs#L89)
  - Implementation: `EncryptedPrivateKey` field in DID entity

- **Consent Model**: Explicit user action required for all identity operations
  - No automatic data sharing
  - User controls credential issuance (Phase 3)
  - User controls verification presentation (Phase 4)

**Code References**:
```csharp
// User-initiated DID creation with explicit consent
var createCommand = new Command("create", "Create a new DID");
createCommand.SetHandler(async () => {
    // User must explicitly run this command
    await didService.CreateDidAsync(tenantId);
});
```

**Compliance Level**: **Full Compliance**

---

### 2. Minimal Disclosure

**Principle**: The smallest amount of identifying information is shared, and it's stored securely and deleted quickly.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: âœ… **Partially Implemented (Phase 2)** | ðŸ”„ **Enhanced in Phase 3-4**

**Current Implementation**:

- **Encrypted Storage**: Private keys encrypted at rest
  - Location: [DidCreationService.cs:89](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.DidOperations/Services/DidCreationService.cs#L89)
  - Service: `IKeyEncryptionService` provides AES-256 encryption

- **Minimal Data Model**: Only essential data stored
  - Location: [Did.cs:8-28](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.Data/Entities/Did.cs#L8)
  - Fields: `DidIdentifier`, `PublicKey`, `EncryptedPrivateKey`, `DidDocument`
  - No PII stored in DID records

- **W3C DID Documents**: Support selective disclosure patterns
  - Location: [DidCreationService.cs:75-83](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.DidOperations/Services/DidCreationService.cs#L75)
  - Only public verification keys exposed

**Future Enhancements** (Phase 3-4):

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for credential verification
- Selective Disclosure credentials (reveal only required attributes)
- Time-limited credential presentations
- Automatic data expiration policies

**Code References**:
```csharp
// Minimal data stored - only cryptographic material and metadata
public class Did : BaseEntity
{
    public required string DidIdentifier { get; set; }
    public required string PublicKey { get; set; }
    public required string EncryptedPrivateKey { get; set; }
    public required string DidDocument { get; set; }
    public Guid TenantId { get; set; }
    // No PII, no personal attributes
}
```

**Compliance Level**: **Partial Compliance** (Full compliance planned for Phase 3)

---

### 3. Justification

**Principle**: Only those who can prove they need access can get it.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: ðŸ”„ **Planned (Phase 3-4)**

**Planned Implementation**:

- **Phase 3 (Schema & Credential Issuance)**:
  - Schema-based access control for credential issuance
  - Issuer authorization requirements
  - Credential type restrictions

- **Phase 4 (Verification)**:
  - Proof requests define required credentials
  - Verifiers must justify credential requests
  - Consent-based proof presentation

- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for issuer permissions
  - Audit trails for access requests
  - Policy engine for justification validation

**Architectural Design**:
```
Verifier Request â†’ Proof Request (justification) â†’ User Consent â†’ Selective Disclosure
```

**Compliance Level**: **Not Yet Implemented** (Planned for Phase 3-4)

---

### 4. Directed Identity

**Principle**: Protection of identity is paramount, and users should be assigned private identifiers for that purpose. Companies can't work together to build a more permanent view of someone working across platforms.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: âœ… **Fully Implemented (Phase 2)**

- **Unique DIDs**: Each identity is a cryptographically unique identifier
  - Location: [DidCreationService.cs:63-70](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.DidOperations/Services/DidCreationService.cs#L63)
  - Format: `did:indy:sovrin:{base58(first 16 bytes of verkey)}`
  - Example: `did:indy:sovrin:WgWxqztrNooG92RXvxSTWv`

- **No Correlation**: DIDs cannot be correlated across platforms without user consent
  - Each DID is derived from unique cryptographic keys
  - No central identifier registry
  - No cross-platform tracking possible

- **Pairwise DIDs** (Future): Users can create unique DIDs for each relationship
  - Prevents correlation between different verifiers
  - Location: Planned enhancement to `DidCreationService`

**Code References**:
```csharp
// Unique DID generation from cryptographic keys
string didIdentifier = $"did:indy:sovrin:{publicKeyBase58[..22]}";

// Each DID is cryptographically independent
// No central correlation mechanism exists
```

**Security Properties**:
- **Unlinkability**: Different DIDs cannot be linked to same user
- **Anonymity**: DID alone reveals no personal information
- **User Control**: User decides which DID to use in each context

**Compliance Level**: **Full Compliance**

---

### 5. Competition

**Principle**: Many identity providers should be supported, as competition breeds better performance.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: âœ… **Fully Implemented (Phase 1-2)**

- **Open Standards**: Built on Hyperledger Indy (Linux Foundation)
  - Location: Project-wide architecture
  - DID Method: `did:indy` (W3C DID Core compliant)

- **W3C Compliance**: Implements W3C DID Core Specification
  - Location: [DidCreationService.cs:75-83](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.DidOperations/Services/DidCreationService.cs#L75)
  - Ensures interoperability with other DID methods

- **Pluggable Architecture**: Services defined via interfaces
  - Location: [src/Libraries/HeroSSID.Core/Interfaces/](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.Core/Interfaces/)
  - `IKeyGenerationService`, `IKeyEncryptionService`, `IDidCreationService`
  - Easy to swap implementations

- **Multi-Ledger Support** (Future): Can support multiple DID methods
  - `did:indy`, `did:web`, `did:key`, etc.
  - Location: Architectural design allows DID method abstraction

**Code References**:
```csharp
// Interface-based design supports multiple providers
public interface IDidCreationService
{
    Task<string> CreateDidAsync(Guid tenantId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

// W3C DID Document structure (standard format)
var didDocument = new
{
    context = new[] { "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1" },
    id = didIdentifier,
    verificationMethod = new[] { /* ... */ }
};
```

**Interoperability**:
- Standards-compliant DID Documents
- Compatible with universal resolvers
- No vendor lock-in

**Compliance Level**: **Full Compliance**

---

### 6. Human Integration

**Principle**: A real person has a place in the process, reducing the risk of computer-to-computer hacks.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: âœ… **Implemented (Phase 2)** | ðŸ”„ **Enhanced in Future Phases**

**Current Implementation**:

- **CLI User Interaction**: All operations require human initiation
  - Location: [DidCommands.cs:31-55](../../src/Cli/HeroSSID.Cli/Commands/DidCommands.cs#L31)
  - User must type commands explicitly

- **Status Feedback**: Real-time feedback to user
  - Location: [DidCommands.cs:35-45](../../src/Cli/HeroSSID.Cli/Commands/DidCommands.cs#L35)
  - Uses Spectre.Console for interactive UI

- **No Automation**: No automatic credential issuance or verification
  - User consent required for every operation
  - Prevents silent data sharing

**Future Enhancements**:

- **Web UI** (Phase 5): User-friendly interface for identity management
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Additional human verification
- **Biometric Integration**: Hardware-backed key storage
- **Consent Screens**: Explicit approval for data sharing

**Code References**:
```csharp
// Human interaction required
createCommand.SetHandler(async () =>
{
    await AnsiConsole.Status()
        .StartAsync("Creating DID...", async ctx =>
        {
            // User watches progress
            string didId = await didService.CreateDidAsync(tenantId);

            // User receives feedback
            AnsiConsole.MarkupLine($"[green]âœ“[/] DID created: [cyan]{didId}[/]");
        });
});
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Prevents automated attacks
- User awareness of all operations
- Audit trail of user actions

**Compliance Level**: **Full Compliance**

---

### 7. Consistency

**Principle**: The users have a simple, consistent experience among platforms.

**HeroSSID Implementation**: ðŸ”„ **Partially Implemented (Phase 2)** | ðŸ”„ **Enhanced in Phase 3-5**

**Current Implementation**:

- **Consistent CLI Pattern**: All commands follow same structure
  - Location: [src/Cli/HeroSSID.Cli/Commands/](../../src/Cli/HeroSSID.Cli/Commands/)
  - Pattern: `herossid <noun> <verb>` (e.g., `herossid did create`)

- **Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error messages
  - Location: [LoggingConfiguration.cs](../../src/Libraries/HeroSSID.Observability/LoggingConfiguration.cs)
  - Structured logging with Serilog

- **Standard Response Format**: All operations return consistent output
  - Success: Green checkmark + confirmation
  - Error: Red X + error message
  - Progress: Spinner with status text

**Future Enhancements**:

- **Web UI** (Phase 5): Consistent visual design across all operations
- **Mobile App** (Future): Same experience on mobile devices
- **API Standards**: RESTful API with consistent patterns
- **Documentation**: Unified documentation structure

**Code References**:
```csharp
// Consistent command structure across all operations
public static class DidCommands
{
    public static Command CreateCommand(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { }
    public static Command ResolveCommand(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { }
    public static Command ListCommand(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { }
}

public static class CredentialCommands
{
    public static Command IssueCommand(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { }
    public static Command VerifyCommand(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { }
    // Same pattern as DID commands
}
```

**User Experience Goals**:
- Learn once, use everywhere
- Predictable behavior
- Clear feedback
- Minimal cognitive load

**Compliance Level**: **Partial Compliance** (Full compliance planned for Phase 5)
