## Slide 2: The Global Moment

**SSI Goes Mainstream in 2025**

**Left Column - The Stats:**
- W3C VC 2.0 published as **official standard** (May 2025)
- EU mandates digital identity wallets for **448M citizens** (Nov 2026)

## Slide 3: The Problem

**Australia Lacks Digital Sovereignty**

**For Individuals:**
- Identity controlled by tech giants (Google, Facebook, Microsoft)
- No portable credentials (start from scratch every time)
- Privacy invasion (data harvesting)

**For Businesses:**
- Weeks to verify credentials (employees, suppliers, partners)
- KYC/AML compliance costs: $500M+ annually
- Cross-border friction (APAC trade)

**For Australia:**
- Strategic dependence on foreign infrastructure
- No control over citizen identity data
- Missing the SSI revolution (EU/US leading)

**Visual**: Icons showing fragmented identity landscape, data silos

## Slide 4: The Solution

**HeroSSID: Australia's Decentralized Identity Platform**

**What It Is:**
- W3C-compliant SSI infrastructure
- Government-grade security (.NET 9, PostgreSQL)
- Australian sovereignty (data residency, legal jurisdiction)

**How It Works:**
1. **Issuers** create verifiable credentials (universities, government, employers)
2. **Holders** store credentials in digital wallets (own their data)
3. **Verifiers** instantly validate credentials (no central authority)

**Key Differentiators:**
- ‚úÖ W3C standards (global interoperability)
- ‚úÖ Open-source core (transparency, community)
- ‚úÖ Australian-built (sovereignty, support)
- ‚úÖ Enterprise-ready (.NET ecosystem)

**Visual**: Three-party trust triangle (Issuer ‚Üí Holder ‚Üí Verifier)
