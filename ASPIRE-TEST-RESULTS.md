# Aspire Infrastructure Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Test Type**: Initial Aspire orchestration verification
**Status**: ⚠️ Partial Success

## Test Summary

Tested the .NET Aspire AppHost to verify infrastructure orchestration before Phase 2 implementation.

### ✅ What Worked

1. **Aspire Dashboard Started Successfully**
   - Dashboard accessible at: `https://localhost:17062`
   - Login URL: `https://localhost:17062/login?t=43c97064e92f208c10bd58a147749ae2`
   - Aspire version: 9.5.1+286943594f648310ad076e3dbfc11f4bcc8a3d83

2. **Docker Connection Verified**
   - Docker daemon is running
   - Aspire can communicate with Docker
   - Docker CLI commands work

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Indy Pool Container Failed to Start**

   **Error:**
   ```
   fail: Aspire.Hosting.Dcp.dcpctrl.dcpctrl.ContainerReconciler[0]
         Could not create the container
         {"Container": "/indy-pool-jrmqnfut", "Reconciliation": 7,
          "ContainerName": "indy-pool-jrmqnfut",
          "error": "docker command 'CreateContainer' returned with non-zero exit code 1"}
   ```

   **Root Cause**: Von Network Docker image (`bcgovimages/von-network:latest`) is not present locally

2. **PostgreSQL Status Unknown**
   - Unclear if PostgreSQL container started (no logs in output)
   - Need to verify via dashboard or `docker ps`

## Analysis

### Indy Pool Container Issue

The Von Network image needs to be pulled before Aspire can start it. Aspire attempts to create the container but fails because:

1. Image doesn't exist locally: `bcgovimages/von-network:latest`
2. Aspire doesn't automatically pull images on first run (by design)
3. Manual pull required: `docker pull bcgovimages/von-network:latest`

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

**Expected:**
- Aspire pulls images automatically on first run
- All containers start successfully
- Dashboard shows green status for all resources

**Actual:**
- Aspire started dashboard successfully ✅
- Indy pool container failed (image not found) ❌
- PostgreSQL status unknown ⚠️

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Pull Images Manually (Quick Fix)

```bash
# Pull the Von Network image
docker pull bcgovimages/von-network:latest

# Pull PostgreSQL if needed (Aspire usually handles this)
docker pull postgres:17

# Restart Aspire
cd src/Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
dotnet run
```

**Time**: 5-10 minutes (depending on download speed)

### Option 2: Use docker-compose for Initial Pull (Alternative)

Since we deleted docker-compose.yml, we could temporarily recreate it just for pulling images:

```bash
# Create temporary docker-compose.yml
docker-compose -f /path/to/backup/docker-compose.yml pull

# Then start Aspire
cd src/Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
dotnet run
```

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

### Option 3: Proceed with Phase 2 Without Full Infrastructure (Not Recommended)

We could implement Phase 2 DID operations without the Indy pool running, using mocks/stubs. However, this defeats the purpose of integration testing.

**Time**: Immediate, but delays integration testing

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Pull Images Manually)

**Rationale:**
- Fastest and cleanest approach
- One-time operation (images cached afterward)
- Follows Aspire best practices
- Verifies full infrastructure before implementation

**Steps:**

1. **Pull Von Network Image**
   ```bash
   docker pull bcgovimages/von-network:latest
   ```

2. **Restart Aspire**
   ```bash
   cd src/Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Verify Dashboard**
   - Open `https://localhost:17062`
   - Check that both PostgreSQL and Indy pool show as "Running"
   - Verify all health checks pass

4. **Test Database Connection**
   ```bash
   cd src/Libraries/HeroSSID.Data
   dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../../Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
   ```

5. **Proceed to Phase 2 Implementation**

## Infrastructure Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Aspire Dashboard** | ✅ Running | https://localhost:17062 |
| **Docker Daemon** | ✅ Running | Communication verified |
| **PostgreSQL** | ❓ Unknown | Needs verification via dashboard |
| **Indy Pool** | ❌ Failed | Image not found: bcgovimages/von-network:latest |
| **PgAdmin** | ❓ Unknown | Needs verification via dashboard |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Aspire doesn't auto-pull custom images** - Unlike docker-compose with `pull_policy: always`, Aspire requires images to be present
2. **Dashboard is valuable** - Even with container failures, the dashboard started successfully for debugging
3. **First-run experience** - Need to document image pulling in setup instructions

## Updates Needed to Documentation

### 1. RUNNING-WITH-ASPIRE.md

Add a "First-Time Setup" section:

```markdown
## First-Time Setup

Before running Aspire for the first time, pull required Docker images:

\`\`\`bash
# Pull Von Network (Hyperledger Indy pool)
docker pull bcgovimages/von-network:latest

# PostgreSQL is automatically pulled by Aspire
# But you can pre-pull it to speed up first run:
docker pull postgres:17
docker pull dpage/pgadmin4:latest
\`\`\`

Then start Aspire:

\`\`\`bash
cd src/Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
dotnet run
\`\`\`
```

### 2. README.md

Update "Quick Start" to mention image pulling:

```markdown
### Setup (5 minutes)

\`\`\`bash
# ... existing steps ...

# Pull Docker images (first-time only)
docker pull bcgovimages/von-network:latest

# Start infrastructure with .NET Aspire
cd src/Services/HeroSSID.AppHost
dotnet run
\`\`\`
```

## Conclusion

Aspire infrastructure test revealed a common first-run issue: missing Docker images. This is easily resolved by manually pulling the Von Network image.

**Next Action**: Pull `bcgovimages/von-network:latest` and restart Aspire to verify full infrastructure.

**Estimated Time to Resolution**: 5-10 minutes

Once resolved, infrastructure will be ready for Phase 2 DID operations implementation.
